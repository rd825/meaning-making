# Tribes, Narratives, & Meaning-Making

This syllabus reflects a proposed broad survey course of the above topics. It, by definition, will not be exhaustive. It will, however, expose students to the notable contours of this space, thereby enabling them to perform their own further inquiry. This work is my Thiel-ian secret, the thing I believe that few others would agree with:

**Tribes and narratives symbiotically create meaning. Meaning can be manipulated through various (yet undefined) attack vectors to simulate group mind control.**

This syllabus is a living document and a work in progress. It reflects my own discovery and scholarship in this space, which I hope will be a collaborative effort with interested others.
